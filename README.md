## Road Accident Analysis
## Project description :-

-> Created a dynamic Excel dashboard to analyse road accident trends over the years 2021 and 2022.    
-> Built data visualizations showing monthly trends of casualties, casualties by road type, road surface, light condition, location and vehicle type, enabling the stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, leading to 
significant reduction in the road accidents.   
-> Utilised MySQL to verify all the KPIs and insights extracted from the Excel dashboard.   
-> Tools Used- MySQL, MS Excel   

## Approach Used:-
1. Requirement gathering from client  

Create a road accident dashboard for the year 2021 and 2022 that focus on these requirements  

Primary KPIs  
-> Total casualties taken place after the accident  
-> Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and casualties by vehicle type.  

Secondary KPIs  
-> Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year  
-> Casualties by road type  
-> Casualties by road surface  
-> Relation b/w Casualties by Location and by Day/Night  


2. Data cleaning in excel  

-> Apply filters and  check every column for missing values or garbage values or wrong input  

-> find and replace wrong input  

-> remove null values (< 2% of the total values)  

3. Data Processing by adding some customized columns in data   

-> Extract month and year from "Accident date" column. = text(accident date, "mmm")   

5. Data Analysis by Pivot Tables and Excel Functions  

-> Data analysis sheet  

6. Data Visualization to create charts and custom sheets to show the insights  

7. Dashboard Creation
